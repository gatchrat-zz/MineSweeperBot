# MineSweeperBot

A very simple Bot that plays the Vista/7 Version of Minesweeper

## How to use
Open Minesweeper on a 1080p Screen in Fullscreen-mode, press Start while Minesweeper is still visible. 
(Open Minesweeper,then open Bot so the bot is over the Minesweeper window without overlaying the actual field)
The Bot will then Play the Game

#Restrictions
Works only for 9x9
Cannot detect when 5 or more bombs are adjacent
Uses only very simple tactics to choose the bomb locations, 
clicks random and not based on probability calculations when not 100% sure where a free field is.
